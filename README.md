# Tensorflow-Colab
Studying Tensorflow with Google Colab. Thanks Google for this platform that every one can work together not only in markdown but also in python. Especially, this platform provides tensorflow. This means that you need only your google account to work online with everything relates to python, keras, panda, tensorflow... You do not need to install alot of things to run tensorflow in your laptop. 
## Working with Google Colab
* Activate tensorflow environment
* First deep neural network example with Tensorflow
### Activate tensorflow in colab
When you open the Google colab you can create new file notebook 3
Rename for it then start with the first line like any language
```
print('Hello World')
```
Then you can install the environment for tensorflow working with GPU by this below command
```
!pip install tensorflow-gpu
```
After about some minutes to download about 400MB to install in your computer. Done, now you can work with Tensorflow online.
```
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.__version__)
```
You will see the new version of tensorflow that you work in.
There are alot of interesting lessons you can learn from the chanel of Google tensorflow with the link below

### First deep neural network example with Tensorflow
For this part, you can see in the file BreastCancer.ipynb that I changed a bit that we can run on our own computer
